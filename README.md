# MNIST-digit-recogniser

## Description:
This notebook contains a program that accurately detects a handwritten digit from 0 - 9. I used numpy, keras, pandas and matplotlib for this project and the help of youtube tutorials. The model contained two layers of 64 neurons, using the relu activation function, and a final layer of 10 neurons using the softmax function. Using 5 epochs and a batch size of 32 led to a respectable accuracy of 0.9776 on the test data.
